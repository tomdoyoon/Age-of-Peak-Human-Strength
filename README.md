# Age-of-Peak-Human-Strength

# Abstract

Commonly held beliefs suggest that there exists a pinnacle age for athletic prowess, a zenith of strength, beyond which continuous improvement wanes. As biological organisms, humans inevitably face a period of decline as age advances. This study delves into the question of when humans reach their peak strength. Is it in their early 20s, mid-20s, or perhaps early 30s? The revelations from our findings may defy conventional expectations.

In this comprehensive analysis, strength is quantified across four key metrics: the maximum squat, bench press, deadlift, and a composite measure of these lifts. Our dataset encompasses all powerlifting events post-2018-01-01. Admittedly, inherent biases require acknowledgment, notably the exclusivity of data derived solely from competitive lifters. Undoubtedly, there are gaps in our understanding of human performance and strength measures among non-competitive individuals. However, given the burgeoning popularity of Powerlifting and its diverse following across age, socioeconomic strata, and geographic locations, our focus on the competitive lifter demographic offers a robust representation of those who approach gym-going with a dedicated regimen. Ultimately, our inquiry is centered on the attainment of peak strength, and the average gym-goer who abstains from competition falls outside the scope of our analysis.

This study adopts a tripartite lens, examining sub-populations within the realm of competitive Powerlifting. These subgroups consist of the top performers subject to drug testing, the top non-drug tested athletes, and a broader category termed the "general population" of lifters. While the delineation of the first two groups is straightforward, the designation of the general population warrants disclosure of an inherent bias. Our methodology entails selecting lifters falling within the interquartile range (25% to 75%) of each drug-tested weight group to compose this general population cohort. Consequently, individuals who commence their competitive journey in this group, likely younger and less experienced, may outgrow this general population status over time, progressing to surpass the 75th percentile threshold. Consequently, the data within the general population subset may skew towards a younger age for the purported "peak" performance.
